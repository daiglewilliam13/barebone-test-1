When it comes to cookware, I always opt for stainless steel over non-stick or Teflon options. The risks associated with these alternatives far outweigh any perceived benefits. Non-stick coatings can release toxic fumes when heated to high temperatures, while Teflon has been linked to chemical hazards like PFOA and PFOS. These chemicals have been shown to be carcinogenic and even found in our drinking water. In contrast, stainless steel cookware is a safe and durable choice that can withstand high heat without compromising on flavor or performance.

The truth is, if you can do anything with an expensive All-Clad pan, you can do it with a more affordable set of stainless steel cookware. The technique and skill required to cook a perfect dish remain the same regardless of the price tag. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced chef, a good quality stainless steel set will allow you to achieve professional-grade results without breaking the bank. You'll be able to sear meat, saut√© vegetables, and simmer sauces with ease, all while knowing that your cookware is free from toxic chemicals.

So why choose stainless steel over non-stick or Teflon? For one, it's a healthier option for cooking. Two, it's incredibly durable and can withstand high heat without losing its non-stick properties. And three, it's affordable! You don't have to spend hundreds of dollars on an All-Clad set to get quality stainless steel cookware. There are plenty of options available at lower price points that still offer excellent performance.
